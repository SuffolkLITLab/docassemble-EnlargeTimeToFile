  Motion for Enlargement of Time to File Brief

  If for some reason you cannot meet the prescribed deadline in which to serve and file your brief and appendix, or a status report, you may file a motion with the Appeals Court asking for more time.
  
  The motion must set forth the reasons for the requested extension, provide a date certain by which the brief will be filed, and must be accompanied by a certificate of service which lists the name of the document being served, the date of service, the manner of service (e.g., first class mail, in hand service, or e-service through eFileMA.com), and the names and addresses of all parties being served.
  
  A copy of the motion must be served on all other parties to the appeal.
